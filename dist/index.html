            Reels was a collaborative application that utilizes a movie database
            (themoviedb.org) to return all movies of a chosen genre within a

            to mimmic "swiping" like on dating apps). My role on this project
            was front-end engineer, and I worked with a second front-end
            engineer and a back-end engineer.

          <h3>Web Development Portfolio Projects (2021)</h3>
          <p>
            My focus throughout the Codecademy learning path has been to get my
            hands dirty with real practical projects, in both independent and
            team settings. These are the projects listed above in the Portfolio
            section.
          </p>
          <h3>Codecademy Full Stack Career Path (2021)</h3>
          <p>
            Codecademy is a leader of self-paced online education for tech.
            Their lessons and exercises have been useful to gain fundamental
            understanding of all the topics and skills needed for web
            development, and I frequently expand on topics learned through
            independent study and projects. I began this course in February
            2021, and am currently 33% through it. I have completed most of the
            front-end work, with mostly back-end and framework material to go.
          </p>
          <h3>Geologist at Chevron (2018-2020)</h3>
          <p>
            At chevron I practiced working in complex multi-disciplinary teams
            on highly technical projects. I gained project management skills,
            and learned first hand the delicate balance between deadlines and
            "perfect" technical work. Although my geologic technical skills are
            not directly related to programming, geology is all about solving
            complex spatial and temporal problems which I believe have analogous
            applications in web development.
          </p>
          <h3>M.S. in Geology, University of Utah (2018)</h3>
          <p>
            My research incorporated spatial statistics with traditional
            geologic field work to quantify the geometry of sandstone bodies in
            southern Utah. I collected 4.5 km of drone imagery and GPS data,
            with which I developed a 3D photorealistic model of the outcrop. I
            then interpreted channel belts on the model and transformed them
            using ArcGIS into a dataset of points and polygons to perform
            statistical analyses on in MATLAB. This was my introduction to both
            coding and advanced statistical techniques. Without formal education
            on these skills, I was able to overcome many challenges and produce
            code that did complex statistical analyses on my dataset. I used
            both spatial point pattern analyses and more traditional analyses
            (average thickness of sand bodies, area of sand bodies, etc.) across
            various sizes of moving windows to allow greater prediction from 1D
            to 2D and 3D. My results can be used as an analog by those working
            in the subsurface to improve their predictions.
          </p>
          <h3>B.S. in Geology, UNC Wilmington (2015)</h3>
          <p>
            Undergraduate Research: Sandstone petrofacies and detrital zircon
            geochronology of the Permian–Early Jurassic Baker terrane mélange
            belt, northeastern Oregon. Presented as a poster at the Southeastern
            GSA Section Meeting, 2015. Advisor: Dr. Todd LaMaskin, Co-author:
            Dr. Josh Schwartz. Through this research I received ample practice
            using the petrographic microscope, particularly for sandstone
            petrography. I developed basic lab skills such as cutting rocks for
            thin section production, and using the jawcrusher to prepare
            mudrocks for geochemical analysis. I practiced basic skills in
            Chemistry, Physics, and Calculus.
